# Welcome to My GitHub!

You're probably wondering why you're here? This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive overview of all my technical projects and ongoing work that might not be mentioned on my main website or LinkedIn. 

Here is a brief overview of Main Website vs. my GitHub

### Main Website

My main website www.justin-bento.com/ is dedicated to showcasing the projects, in a visually engaing way feel free to check it out. 

### GitHub

My GitHub repository, on the other hand, is for developers like myself who care about the code and technical details. Here, you'll find:
- **Source Code:** The actual code behind my projects, available for you to explore, use, and contribute to.
- **Ongoing Projects:** Sneak peeks into what I'm currently working on, including experimental and in-progress projects.
- **Open-Source Contributions:** Take a look at the projects I follow and the contributions I make to them.
- **Explore My Config Files:** Take a look at my configuration files and see how I set things up.
