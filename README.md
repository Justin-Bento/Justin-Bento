# Welcome to My GitHub!

If you're from LinkedIn you're probably wondering why you're here? This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive overview of all my technical projects and ongoing work that might not be mentioned on my main website. 

Here is a brief overview of Main Website vs. my GitHub

### Main Website

My main website is dedicated to telling the story of how each project came to be. It focuses on the journey, challenges, and insights gained throughout the development process. If you're interested in the narrative behind the projects, feel free to check it out

### GitHub

This GitHub repository, on the other hand, is for nerds like myself who care about the code and technical details. Here, you'll find:
- **Source Code:** The actual code behind my projects, available for you to explore, use, and contribute to.
- **(In progress) Technical Documentation:** Documentation on how to use, modify, and build upon the projects.
- **Ongoing Projects:** Sneak peeks into what I'm currently working on, including experimental and in-progress projects.
