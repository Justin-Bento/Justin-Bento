Hey, My name is Justin Bento!

I am a FullStack Software Developer, who enjoys building websites with JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and Ruby. 

My traditional education is a Multimedia Desginer. Who was able to teach myself how to code while having a design-first mentality. 

With this mentality in mind I am able to create the literal UI/UX of an application and link it back to code.  WHich has been a rule of mine that Iâ€™ve applied across all the projects on my GitHub.

I am currently seeking a full-time position where I can contribute to a team and provide my wide array of skills to the company.

Check out my projects below or in the repository tab, and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinbento/).
