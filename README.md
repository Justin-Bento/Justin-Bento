# Main Website

My main website, www.justin-bento.com, is dedicated to showcasing my projects in a visually engaging way. Feel free to check it out!

## GitHub
My GitHub repository, on the other hand, is for developers like myself who care about the code and technical details. Here, you'll find:

- **Source Code:** The actual code behind my projects, available for you to explore, use, and contribute to.
- **Ongoing Projects:** Sneak peeks into what I'm currently working on, including experimental and in-progress projects.
- **Open-Source Contributions:** A look at the projects I follow and the contributions I make to them.
- **Configuration Files:** Explore my setup and configuration files to see how I organize my workflows.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
